      <h2>About Me</h2>

      <p>
        I am a third-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at
        Lovely Professional University with a strong interest in both software
        development and embedded systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy solving problems through programming and also working with
        hardware-based systems to understand how software interacts with
        real-world devices. This dual interest helps me think from a
        system-level perspective.
      </p>

      <p>
        Through academic coursework, laboratory work, industry exposure, and
        hands-on training programs, I have gained experience with
        microcontrollers, embedded programming, sensors, and core computer
        science concepts such as data structures and object-oriented
        programming.
      </p>

      <p>
        I am actively looking for opportunities where I can apply my skills,
        continue learning, and grow as an engineer in software or embedded
        roles.

  <div class="experience-card">
    <h3>Embedded Systems Intern</h3>
    <p class="org">Varisis Advanced Engineering Pvt. Ltd.</p>
    <p class="duration">Summer Internship</p>
    <p>
      Worked on a Perimeter Intrusion Detection System (PIDS) using Arduino
      Nano 33 BLE Sense, focusing on sensor-based intrusion detection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collected and processed sensor data and explored edge-based intelligence
      using Edge Impulse to understand basic machine learning workflows on
      embedded devices.
    </p>
    <p>
      This internship strengthened my understanding of embedded systems,
      real-time data handling, and hardware–software integration in
      industrial environments.

    <h3>Women in Engineering Workshop</h3>
    <p class="org">Padmini VNA Mechatronics, Gurugram</p>
    <p class="duration">2-Day Technical Workshop</p>
    <p>
      Attended a hands-on Women in Engineering workshop focused on industrial
      exposure, mechatronics systems, and embedded applications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gained insights into real-world engineering practices, interdisciplinary
      system design, and the importance of industry-ready technical skills.
    </p>
    <p>
      Interacted with industry professionals, improving my understanding of
      teamwork, professional communication, and applied engineering
      problem-solving.
